It's My Life -- Bon Jovi

This ain't a code for the broken hearted.
No silent prayer for the faith departed.
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd.
You're gonna hear my voice.
when I shout it out aloud.

It's my life.
It's now or never.
I ain't gonna live forever.
I just want to live while I'm alive.
(It's my life.)
My heart is like an open highway.
Like Frankie said.
I did it my way.
I just wanna live while I'm alive.
It's my life.

This is for the ones who stood their ground.
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down.
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake.
Luck ain't even lucky.
Got to make your own breaks.

It's my life.
And it's now or never.
I ain't gonna live forever.
I just want to live while I'm alive.
(It's my life.)
My heart is like an open highway.
Like Frankie said.
I did it my way.
I just wanna live while I'm alive.
(It's my life.)

Batter stand tall when they're calling you out.
Don't end don't break baby don't back down.

It's my life.
And it's now or never.
I ain't gonna live forever.
I just want to live while I'm alive.
(It's my life.)
My heart is like an open highway.
Like Frankie said.
I did it my way.
I just wanna live while I'm alive.
(It's my life.)

It's now or never.
I ain't gonna live forever.
I just want to live while I'm alive.
(It's my life.)
My heart is like an open highway.
Like Frankie said.
I did it my way.
I just wanna live while I'm alive.
(It's my life.)
